Algorithms for Automatically Reconstructing CSPAD Geometry


A bunch of us are working on optimizing the CSPAD Geometry automatically -- it would be good for all of us to communicate often about our successes and failures to optimize time spent on the project.

This git repo can act as a central place for us to collaborate on code, share training images, and chat about what works and what doesn't.

Feel free to write comments in this readme about what you've tried and what you're working on.

* Tried: Hough Transform. Was slow/not robust.
* Working On: Optimizing the radial FWHM of a binary representation of the image
