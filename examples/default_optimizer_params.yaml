# Default parameter file: for use with script: optgeom
#
# this file contains *all* the parameters that one can set in an optimization
# run and their default values. Most of them you won't want to change, and
# those that you can change are most easily set via the calibrate-filter script

# objective function parameters
peak_weight:     0.0                # cost of adding another peak in the obj fxn
width_weight:    0.0                # cost of making a peak wider

# image filtering parameters
use_edge_filter: True               # use a filter on the image
threshold:       0.00045            # the filter threshold value
medf_size:       5                  # the median filter window size
minf_size:       3                  # the minimum filter window size

# radial projection smoothing and width computation parameters
horizontal_cut:  0.25               # what height to compute the peak widths at
beta:            10.0               # the strength of a smoothing window applied
window_size:     10                 # the size of the smoothing window

# geometric parameters
pixel_size:      0.10992            # the pixel dimensions (assumed square)
radius_range:    []                 # the radial range to optimize (even length)
beam_loc:        [900.0, 870.0]     # the beam location on the image
plot_each_iteration : True          # plot the quads while optimizing
