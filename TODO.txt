To Do for autogeom
------------------

We need to decide if we are going with the psana alignment parameter scheme
or directly with the optical metrology.

The former has the advantage of working well with the rest of psana. The latter
has the possible advantage of being more accurate.

-- add offset_coor_xy functionality
-- make optimizer agnostic to cspad vs. metrology
-- finish cspad pixel map service
-- include default CSPad
-- automatic miller index matching (in score)
-- write default param yaml
-- GPL everything
